# hello-world
I am Savitha Dhandapani, a pure biologist until few weeks back. But now, I want to change career paths from academics to industry. My hope is that by learning python and becoming good at data science, I will be able to secure a position in Healthcare and related industries.

Anyways, this is my first repository. Hoping to turn into a data scientist in few months.
